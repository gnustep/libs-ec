  /* This file configures the names/passwords of the people allowed to use
   * the Console program to control the system and the commands that each
   * operator may use.
   *
   * On systems where security is not an issue, the Password my be an empty
   * string (allows any login attempt) or may be identical to the username
   * (the user must enter their username as their password).
   *
   * The format for a hashed password is that created by the mkpasswd
   * program and the crypt() function.  The SHA512 hash (starts '$6$')
   * is preferred.
   *
   * As a special case, the password '-' may be used for a dummy operator
   * entry which does not permit login to the Console, but defines a set
   * of commands referenced from other entries.
   *
   * The (optional) Commands value is either an array listing the commands
   * that the operator can use, or the name of another operator entry which
   * contains such a list of commands.
   *
   * The omission of the Commands entry means that the commands array is
   * supplied from the default entry (if there is one).
   * If there is no Commands entry for the operator, and no entry for the
   * default operator (or no default operator), all commands are available,
   * but otherwise any error in the config (a Commands entry which is neither
   * a string nor an array, or a string which does not reference an operator
   * entry with a Command array) means that no commands are available.
   * An entry of the form 'Commands = ();' for the default operator is
   * sufficient to disable all commands for all operators until/unless
   * commands are specifically enabled for them.
   *
   * NB. There are a few special cases for commands as follows:
   * The 'quit' command is always permitted for the Console itself, and
   * only needs to be listed to quit client processes, Command or Control.
   * The special key words for routing commands; 'connect', 'tell', and 'on'
   * are not considered to be commands and therefore do not need to be
   * listed in Commands arrays.
   * The 'config' command needs to be listed for at least one operator in
   * order to be able to change configuration.  Without it, configuration
   * could only be changed by killing and restarting the Control server.
   *
   * Just add a definition for yourself as below:
