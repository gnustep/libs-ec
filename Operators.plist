  /* This file configures the names/passwords of the people allowed to use
   * the Console program to control the system and the commands that each
   * operator may use.
   *
   * There may be a default operator configuration specified (using an empty
   * string as its name) which behaves specially.
   *
   * The Password field normally contains a password hash used to authenticate
   * login as that operator, but may also be an empty string (allows any login
   * attempt) or may be identical to the username (the user must enter their
   * username as their password) or may be a hyphen (to prevent login as that
   * operator).
   *
   * The format for a hashed password is that created by the mkpasswd
   * program and the crypt() function.  The SHA512 hash (starts '$6$')
   * is preferred.
   *
   * The (optional) Commands value is either an array listing the commands
   * that the operator can use, or the name of another operator entry which
   * contains such a list of commands. The referenced operator entry defines
   * a 'role' capable of executing the defined set of commands.
   *
   * When the password '-'  is used to prevent login, the Commands setting
   * of the operator may still be referenced as a role by the entries of
   * other operators.
   *
   * The omission of the Commands entry means that the commands array is
   * supplied from the default entry (if there is one).
   * If there is no Commands entry for the operator, and no entry for the
   * default operator (or no default operator), all commands are available,
   * but otherwise any error in the config (a Commands entry which is neither
   * a string nor an array, or a string which does not reference an operator
   * entry with a Command array) means that no commands are available.
   * An entry of the form 'Commands = ();' for the default operator is
   * sufficient to disable all commands for all operators until/unless
   * commands are specifically enabled for them.
   *
   * It is possible to log in to the Console using an operator name which is
   * not explicitly configured.  In that case the default operator entry is
   * used as follows:
   * 1. The Passord from the default entry is used to permit/refuse the login.
   * 2. The Commands from the default entry is used to define the commands that
   * the operator may use, and if this is not present no commands may be used.
   *
   * NB. There are a few special cases for commands as follows:
   * The 'quit' command is always permitted for the Console itself, and
   * only needs to be listed to quit client processes, Command or Control.
   * The special key words for routing commands; 'connect', 'tell', and 'on'
   * are not considered to be commands and therefore do not need to be
   * listed in Commands arrays.
   * The 'config' command needs to be listed for at least one operator in
   * order to be able to change configuration.  Without it, configuration
   * could only be changed by killing and restarting the Control server.
   *
   * Just add a definition for yourself as below:
