 *   <desc>
 *     This may be used to control the alarm severity level at which the

 *     means that alarms are raised as soon as the base/allowed memory limit
 *     is passed, while setting it to Critical only causes an alarm to be

 *     The default value is Major (the possible values are Warning, Minor,

 *     If this setting is not specified (or a negative or excessive value
 *     is specified) then memory is monitored for ten minutes and the

 *     This optional integer value (0 to 23) may be used to specify the hour
 *     of the day in which restarts are preferred to take place (some time
 *     when the process is likely to be idle).  If a process is near a
 *     maximum permitted memory usage at this time of day,
 *     the -ecRestart: method will be called.<br />
 *     Near means over three quarters of the way between the base/allowed
 *     memory usage (as determined by MemoryAllowed) and MemoryMaximum.<br />
 *     This may be set in the NSUserDefaults system or in Control.plist,
 *     but may be overridden by using the 'memory' command in the
 *     Console program.
 *   </desc>
 *   <term>EcMemoryMaximum</term>
 *   <desc>
 *     This may be used to specify the maximum process memory allowed
 *     (in megabytes by default) before the process is forced to restart due
 *     to excessive memory usage.<br />
 *     If the total memory usage of the process reaches this threshold,
 *     the -ecRestart: method will be called<br />
 *     The process will also generate alarms depending on the memory usage
 *     once the bas/allowed memory usge has been passed.  The severity of
 *     the alarms depends on how far from the base/allowed memory to the
 *     maximum memory the current ten minute average of the usage is.<br />
 *     This may be set in the NSUserDefaults system or in Control.plist,
 *     but may be overridden by using the 'memory' command in the
 *     Console program.
 *   </desc>
 *   <term>EcMemoryType</term>
 *   <desc>
 *    This controls the type of memory considered by the EcMemoryAllowed,
 *    EcMemoryIdle and EcMemoryMaximum options.<br />
 *    Total (the default), considers the total process memory usage.<br />
 *    Resident, considers current resident memory used.<br />
 *    Data, considers only dynamically allocated and stack memory.<br />
 *    While using Total and Resident are easy to relate to the output of
 *    system tools such as <code>ps</code> and <code>top</code>, the Data
 *    memory type is probably of most use for tracking memory leaks on a
 *    system with many processes running, since it excludes memory shared
 *    between multiple processes (used for the program code and for shared
 *    libraries).
 *   </desc>
 *   <term>EcMemoryUnit</term>
 *   <desc>
 *    This controls the units in which memory information is displayed,
 *    the default being K/KB/KiB (1024 bytes).  Other possible settings are
 *    M/MB/MiB (1048576 bytes) and P/Pg/Page (system memory pages, typically
 *    4096 bytes). 
 *   </desc>
 *   <term>EcRelease</term>
 *   <desc>
 *     This boolean value determines whether checks for memory problems
 *     caused by release an object too many times are done.  Turning
 *     this on has a big impact on program performance and is not
 *     recommended except for debugging crashes and other memory
 *     issues.<br />
 *     This may be set in the NSUserDefaults system or in Control.plist,
 *     but may be overridden by using the 'release' command in the
 *     Console program.
 *   </desc>
 *   <term>EcTesting</term>
 *   <desc>
 *     This boolean value determines whether the server is running in
 *     test mode (which may enable extra logging or prevent the server
 *     from communicating with live systems etc ... the actual
 *     behavior is server dependent).<br />
 *     This may be set on the command line or in Control.plist, but
 *     may be overridden by using the 'testing' command in the
 *     Console program.
 *   </desc>
 *   <term>EcWellKnownHostNames</term>
 *   <desc>A dictionary mapping host aliases to well known names (the
 *   canonical values used by Command and Control) and/or real host names.

 * </deflist>
 * Alarm mechanism
 * <p>
 *   The EcProcess class conforms to the EcAlarmDestination protocol
 *   to allow sending alarm information to a centralised alarm system
 *   via the Command server (the Control server acts as a sink for
 *   those alarms and provides SNMP integration).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   In addition to the standard alarm destination behavior, the
 *   process automates some things:<br />
 *   On successful startup and registration with the Command server,
 *   a -domanage: message is automatically sent for the default
 *   managed object, clearing any outstanding alarms.<br />
 *   On successful shutdown (ie when -cmdQuit: is called with zero
 *   as its argument), an -unmanage: message is automatically sent
 *   to clear any outstanding alarms for the default managed object.<br />
 *   If you want to raise alarms which will persist after a successful
 *   shutdown you should therefore do so by creating a different managed
 *   object for which to raise those alarms.
 * </p>
 * <p>As a convenience, the class provides various methods to raise different
 * kinds of alarms for specific common purposes:
