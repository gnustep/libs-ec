2019-10-29 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcClientI.h:
	* EcClientI.m: Remove a couple of methods only used by EcCommand.
	* EcCommand.m: Add more information to launch info and use it to
	ensure that suspended tasks remain suspended if they crash.  Also
	check for task completion in case a task crashes before it can
	establish a DO connection back to the Command server.

2019-10-05 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcLogger.m:
	* EcProcess.m:
	The debug command at the Console should report when debug (STDERR)
	is suppressed.

2019-10-04 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	* EcClientI.m:
	When we ask a client to terminate, turn off restarting flag.
	When a client has restarted, turn off restarting flag.

2019-10-03 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	When processes shut themselves down gracefully, don't relaunch them
	unless they are either configured to autolaunch or are being
	restarted.

2019-09-25 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	Rename launch timeout methods to avoid conflict with EcProcess
	timeouts and make code clearer.

2019-09-25  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* EcCommand.m:
	Fix bugs that prevent the status command from working for
	abbreviated process names.

2019-08-23 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	When checking to see if a process is alive/responding, set a short
	timeout for the DO request to get a proxy to the process so that
	we don't hang waiting for a response that never comes.

2019-08-11 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Add MemoryAlarm config to control at whaich level of 'severity'
	a process actually starts raising alarms about memory usage.

2019-08-10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcMemoryLogger.h: Change protocol to pass more information.
	* EcProcess.h: Update comments/documentation.
	* EcProcess.m: Revise memory usage code to
	Provide resident and data memory stats to the memory logger
	Refrain from generating alerts (remove MemoryIncrement and
	MemoryPercent settings) having a base memory calculated
	simply as the average usage after ten minutes, plus 20 percent.
	Generate alarms for memory usage between the base/allowed value
	and the maximum allowed value.
	Add MemoryIdle setting to specify an 'idle' hour during the day
	in which the process will restart if it's near maximum allowed
	memory (in the critical alarm range).
	Change the status reporting to improve readability.

2019-08-06 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Prevent repeated clears of alarms for newly connected
	clients.  Use a flag to record that a client is considered 'stable'
	and has already had alarms cleared.

2019-07-15 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Change -ecWillQuit: behavior so that repeated calls are ignored rather
	than causing the process to abort;  the risk of accidentally aborting
	during a clean shutdown (effectively turning the shutdown into a
	crash) is greater than any utility in having quit force an abort (the
	OS 'kill' command is adequate for that) of any process still capable
	of responding to the request over Distributed Objects.
	Added method to see how long we have been quitting, and method to
	set how long we are allowed to quit.

2019-07-12 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Have ecHandleQuit call ecDidQuit in the main thread.  That way an
	application can make the handling run in one thread, and still
	have the final shutdown done in the main thread.

2019-05-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Add EcMemoryTypeto control what type of memory usage we track:
	Total, Resident, or Data (stack and heap).

2019-05-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.h:
	* EcControl.m:
	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Tweaks to allow a new Command process to ask running clients to
	reconnect to it immediately, so that it doesn;t try to launch
	client processes unnecessarily.

2019-05-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.m: Stream alarm information to Console for Wolfgang.

2019-05-27  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcUserDefaults.h:
	* EcUserDefaults.m:
	Extend API to allow temporary defaults overrides to have a specific
	limited life span (an interval after which they can be purged from
	the defaults database).
	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m: Change error about long lived defaults to be warning.
	Change 'defaults' command to support specific lifetime settings from
	1 to 168 hours.  Add APIs for logging exceptions and other unexpected
	software/data errors using NSLog() and alarms.
	Add convenience macros for logging exeptions or code/data errors.

2019-05-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlerter.m: Allow dot to match line separators so we can readily
	work with multi-line text.

2019-05-22  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlerter.m: Add capture group support for Extra1 and Extra2

2019-05-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: For 'quit all' fix code to wait 35 seconds before
	sending a second quit to recalcitrant processes.
	For 'restart all', do not send a second restart to processes as
	that would force a quit in the middle of shutting down cleanly,
	instead wait up to 35 seconds for all processes to shut down.

2019-05-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcCommand.m: Replace -terminate with -terminate: method.
	* Terminate.m: Extend termination to control the time allowed for the
	graceful shutdown (default to 30 seconds).

2019-05-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcCommand.m: New method to return count of active clients.
	* Terminate.m: New help output and option to wait until Command
	server shuts down (printing out number of active clients).

2019-05-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Add status command for daiagnostics.

2019-05-05  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	Rewrite code for launching/relaunching processes so that a crashing
	process will not get relaunched too frequently (eg filling a disk
	with core dumps).  We employ a fibonacci sequence to produce
	increasing delays between successive launch failures (starting with
	a tenth of a second).  This sequence is not reset simply because a
	process launches successfully, the process must also stay alive and
	respond to a few 'pings' before it is considered a successful launch
	causing the inter-launch delay to be reset.
	Also, from the second relaunch onwards in any sequence of failures,
	the -CoreSize 0 arguments are passed to the lanched process to tell
	it ti suppress core dumps.

2019-03-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Add KillDebugOutput option to configure a process to avoid logging
	on systems where logged information should not be available for
	security reasons.  This option is not overidable from the Console.

2019-02-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.m: If we get an alarm clear before we have reported the
	original alarm, we should report the alarm before reporting the
	clear.
	* EcCommand.m: Be slower to clear alarms on client startup;  in case
	it's just going to crash fairly immediately.

2019-02-11  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Relaunch process more rapidly, turn off alarm coalesce.
	* EcControl.m: Turn off alarm coalesce
	* EcProcess.[hm]: Expose the alarm destination object.

2019-02-11  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* EcAlerter.m: Define Regex class as a simple wrapper around
	NSRegularExpression.

2019-02-08  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* EcAlerter.m: Only ignore invalid rules in setRules: and update
	the cached rules with the remaining rules.

2019-02-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Allow the Command server to launch multiple tasks at
	the same time.  Provide LaunchLimit config to specify the maximum
	number of concurrent launches (in case launching a large number of
	processes all at once would overload the hardware). Once the limit
	of launching tasks is reached, new tasks should be launched as and
	when launching tasks complete their startup and register with the
	Command server.
	Add suspend and resume command to control whether the Command server
	will actually launch/relaunch tasks, along with a LaunchStartSuspended
	user default to control whether launching starts as soon as the Command
	server starts up (by default launching is not suspended on startup).

2018-12-11  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Improve  alarm generation to cover the case of hung
	processes better.

2018-11-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Remove excess comma which was messing up the printf
	formatting of the output of the --help option.

2018-11-22  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Report host name when we report that there are no
	clients.
	* EcControl.m: When a 'tell' command is not sent to a specific host,
	it should go to all the hosts, not to a random one.

2018-11-09  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	EcProcess.m: Call ecAwaken only after registration at the name
	server was successful.

2018-10-24  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlerter.m: Fix off by one error in getting string after colon.
	* EcProcess.m: Correct the number of hex digits we say we want when
	reading in an encryption key.
	* EcControl.m: Improve logging of Console commands and add casts and
	comments to avoid compiler warnings about using an NSHost as a
	dictionary key.
	* Control.m: Change the name of the encryption key we prompt for,
	from 'EcControlKey' to 'master encryption key'.

2018-07-30  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h: Add LT_CONSOLE for messages to be reported in the console
	and also be logged to file as an audit log.
	* EcProcess.m: Add LT_CONSOLE implementation/
	* EcCommand.m: Use LT_CONSOLE for messages about process start/stop.
	* EcControl.m: Add option to turn on/off audit log reporting in Console
	and make it off by default, so we only see audit style logs
	specifically intended for the Console

2018-06-26  armando.pesentigritti@theengagehub.com

	* EcControl.m: Make some events audit logs where they might be security
	or system stability related.

2018-06-25  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlerter.h:
	* EcAlerter.m:
	Extend to permit (simple) handling of audit logs as well as
	error/alert/alarm.
	New -handleAudit:withHost:andServer:timestamp: method.

2018-06-24  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Change quit API to handle the quit in the main thread consistently and
	also provide a mechanism to ensure that handling a quit does not block
	other methods on which graceful shutdown depends.

2018-06-12  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcClientI.h:
	* EcClientI.m:
	* EcCommand.m:
	* EcControl.m:
	* EcProcess.m:
	When we restart clients, store that information so that, when the
	client unregisters, we can immediately add them to the set of
	processes to be launched again (and ensure the next launch attempt
	is in 0.5 of a second or less).  Improve audit messages for restart.
	Remove restart command from individual processes so that it is
	reliably done from Command server.

2018-05-10  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * Control.m:
	* EcControl.m:
        * Command.m:
	* EcCommand.m:
	On restart of the Command server, lanch the new copy after half a
	second rather than the normal 30 seconds.

2018-04-05  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Do not try to compress old debug files if there is
	not enough space on the filesystem for both the uncompressed and
	compressed versions to co-exist while compressing.  Instead delete
	the file and generate an error message.

2018-03-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.m: Allow EcControlKeyTest to be defined to supply a key
	without requring it to be entered from the terminal.  This is solely
	to enable automated testing of systems.

2018-03-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Control.m:
	* EcControl.m:
	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Allow EcControlKey to be an MD5 digest of the expected key, so we can
	easily tell if the expected key was entered correctly.
	Expose method to request entry of a hexadecimal key, with checking
	against an MD5 digest of the expected value.

2018-02-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* AlarmTool.m: Add default values for arguments, suitable for sending
	a test/dummy alarm as an example.
	* Control.m:
	* EcControl.m:
	* ECCL.h:
	Add support for EcControlKey to force a value to be entered from the
	terminal and have that value made available to all processes in the
	cluster (eg so they can use a common encryption key not from disk).

2018-02-20  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	EcAlerter.h:
	EcAlerter.m:
	New type 'Raise' to match only an alarm being raised.  Behavior of
	'Alarm' changed to match both 'Raise' and 'Clear' (and reminders as
	long as ReminderInterval matches).

2018-01-05  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	EcProcess.h:
	EcProcess.m: New -ecRestart: method called when we pass the maximum
	memory usage limit or when a restart command is issued.  The default
	implementation calls the -ecQuitFor:status: method using a status of
	minus one so that the Command server will restart the program after
	it shuts down.
	EcCommand.m: New Launch option 'Time' to specify how long after a
	crash we attempt to re-start an autolaunched program.
	Control.plist: Document launch options better

2018-01-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	EcProcess.h: Improve comments.
	EcProcess.m: Avoid warning about unknown connection on shutdown.
	Rewrite config update code to catch exceptions, ensure that methods
	are called in the correct order so that -cmdUpdated is always last,
	and ensure that -cmdUpdated is called when a local defaults update
	occurs. Also, ignore config updates while process is quitting.

2017-12-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	EcCommand.m: Change default period to start compressing logs to 7 days
	and default for starting del;eting logs to 180 days.

2017-11-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h: 
	* EcProcess.m: New methods for handling clean quitting with abort
	if it takes too long.  Fix the directory in which nightly archived
	logs are placed.
	
2017-09-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Fix for repeated log archiving on startup.

2017-08-09  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* EcProcess.m(ecNewDay:):
	Fix bug where archiving was no longer run every day unless some
	defaults had been changed locally.

2017-06-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	* EcControl.m:
	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Replace cmdArchive: with ecArchive: changing the log file archiving
	model to archive files primarily based on their last modification
	date.  Fixes the bug where files were archived to a folder with the
	wrong date on startup, and simplifies archiving code generally.
	Move startup of timeouts to -ecRun so that they won't occur until
	after all initialisation. Add -ecAwaken, -ecDidAwaken, and
	-ecConfigurationError: to make it easy to initialise stuff at the
	start of -ecRun and to ignore config updates before that happens.
	Improve diagnostic logging for registration failure.

2017-03-06  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmDestination.h:
	* EcAlarmDestination.m:
	Change signature of -setDebug: method to be consistent with other
	classes using a method of the same name.

2017-01-30  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* EcAlarmSinkSNMP.m (pollHeartBeat_handler): Don't use memdup,
	which is replaced by netsnmp_memdup with a different interface in
	net-snmp 5.7.3.

2016-07-20  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* EcConsole.m (-ecRun): Pass distantFuture to -runMode:beforeDate:
	to prevent returning immediately from the run loop after recent
	gnustep-base changes.

2016-06-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.m: Fix bug where alerter config was not always updated
	when changed, and where Control server defaults were lost during
	alerter updates.

2016-05-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: When changing log files on a nightly basis, don't
	close descriptor 2 (stderr).  Instead open the new log and use
	dup2() to switch the new log to be stderr.  Wolfgang spotted that
	the existing code allowed another thread to ned up using the
	descriptor if it opened a device in the gap between the old log
	file being closed and the new one opened.

2016-01-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarm.h:
	* EcAlarm.m:
        * EcAlarmDestination.m: When coalescing alarms, allow a clear and
	alarm to cancel each other out, but only if the alarm is not yet
	active (only queued). Allow alarms to be set to persist in the queue
	for up to 255 seconds to allow more coalescing.
	This lets us raise an alarm which, if cleared within the delay
	period, will never be forwarded anywhere.

2015-11-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Improve output when changing/reading defaults, and
	restore tolerant behavior of doing a read by default.
	* ECAlerter.h: 
	* ECAlerter.m: Remove obsolete methods, and a 'Quiet' configuration
	option, and log alarms (and their disposition) by default.

2015-11-18 	Niels Grewe <niels.grewe@halbordnung.de>

	* EcProcess.m: Fix argument validation when reading/writing defaults.

2015-10-28 	Niels Grewe <niels.grewe@halbordnung.de>

	* EcConsole.m: Use readpassphrase() instead of getpass() if available.
	* configure.ac
	* config.make.in:
	Test for readpassphrase in the C library and libbsd, link if needed.
	* configure:
	* config.h.in:
	Regenerate

2015-10-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcTest.h:
	* EcTest.m:
	Add new function to shut down a process via DO connection.

2015-10-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcUserDefaults.h:
	* EcUserDefaults.m:
	New -revertSettings method to revert all local config settings.
	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Change cmdDefaultDbg to cmdBasicDbg to avoid confusion of the debug
	mode with default settings.
	Add 'defaults revert' command for Console to use.

2015-10-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h: declare new -launch: method
	* EcCommand.m: implement -launch: method
	* EcTest.m: use -launch: when asked to get a connection to a process.

2015-08-25  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* AlarmTool.m:
	* LogTool.m:
	* Terminate.m:
	Set up well known hosts at start.

2015-07-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Be more rigorous about checking instance id values.  Ignore anything
	other than a non-negative integer instance ID.

2015-07-15  Niels Grewe <niels.grewe@halbordnung.de>

	* EcMemoryLogger.h
	* EcProcess.m:
	Add the ability to load a bundle to export memory logs to. Configured
	using the 'MemoryLoggerBundle' default key.

2015-07-13  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Restore lost effect of -ecNotLeaked to moderate changes in our idea
	of when we should generate a warening about potential leaks

2015-07-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Allow 'memory current' to list current object allocation values.
	Report time at which memory stats are generated.
	For allocation changes, also show time of previous report.

2015-07-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Allow the memory monitoring configuration to be set from the Console
	via the 'memory' command.  Improve the help text.  Improve the info
	provided in the debug/error reports.

2015-07-06  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Various tweaks to leak alert generation. Change default initial
	thresholds and change increments after an alert to be based upon
	the *peak* usage at the point when the alert was generated, rather
	than on the previous threshodld.  This reduces the number of alerts
	in a process whose memory usage grows rapidly on startup.

2015-07-03  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Revamp memory handling code to work with total process memory rather
	than heap size.  Report usage in same units as the 'ps' command.

2015-06-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmSinkSNMP.m: Fix stupid mistake setting notificationID.

2015-06-16  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmSinkSNMP.m: Fix error in alarms table oid length.
	* EcCommand.m: Fix error in compression of debug logs.

2015-05-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcLogger.m: When logging to stderr, use lock to synchronise with
	logs produced by gnustep-base NSLog().

2015-05-29  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmSinkSNMP.m: log SNMP errors via the main logging mechanism
	or NSLog.
	* EcControl.m: fix failure to perform includes in some cases.
	* EcAlerter.m: tidyups

2015-03-26  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Control.plist:
	* EcCommand.m:
	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	New options for dealing with I/O.  In EcProcess we can set
	EcKeepStandardError to keep the stderr stream separate from the
	debug logging file.
	When a process is launched from the Command server, we can define
	KeepStandardInput, KeepStandardOutput, and KeepStandardError flags
	in the task info to stop the standard streams from being closed.

2015-03-19  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m:
	* EcAlerter.m:
	Use milliseconds in logging timestamps.

2015-02-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlerter.h: Add options for time-limiting rule activity
	* EcAlerter.m: Implement those options
	* EcProcess.m: Put debug logs in 'DebugLogs' by default.
	* EcCommand.m: Put our logs in 'Logs' by default.
	* EcControl.m: Put our logs in 'Logs' by default.
	Change default logging locations.
	*GNUmakefile: bump version for release

2015-02-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * EcAlarmDestination.m: When coalescing alarms, do not coalesce a
	clear with anything other than an earlier clear for the same event.
	We do not want to risk forwarding a clear without a preceding
	event raising the alarm.

2015-01-26  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * GNUmakefile.preamble: fixup gcc flag filtering
        * EcClientI.h:
          EcClientI.m:
        * EcCommand.m:
        * EcControl.m:
        * EcProcess.h:
        * EcProcess.m:
        Implement forced kill by -terminate method if a client fails to
        close down gracefully within 30 seconds.

	* GNUmakefile.preamble: Fix wrong option letter in sed command.

2015-01-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * EcAlarmDestination.m: When shutting down, only wait for the
	background thread first time ... otherwise we could get into a
	recursive loop calling the -shutdown method while
	waiting for shutdown to complete.

2015-01-07  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac:
	* GNUMakefile.preamble:
	Filter out fstack-protect-strong from snmp cflags because clang
	doesn't support it.

2014-11-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmSinkSNMP.m: Fix incorrect OID setup for alarm table in
	SNMP agent.

2014-11-27  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcUserDefaults.m: The -doubleForKey: method was commented out!
	Restore it.

2014-11-26  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Make -cmdLastIP, -cmdLastOP (and their setters)
	thread-safe.

2014-11-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Add method to register a user default / configuration key to have
	updates for a default automatically trigger a method to handle it,
	and to provide 'help' documentation for command line arguments.
	* EcCommand.m:
	Implement 'restart' command for when we want to quit a server and
	have it start up again.

2014-11-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Check for descriptor leaks at 1 minute intervals,
        and shut down if EcDescriptorsMaximum is exceeded or if the
	process runs out of descriptors.

2014-10-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m:
	* Control.plist:
	Add LaunchOrder config to control the order in which services are
	handled by the Command server.  By default we now do them in
	lexicographic order rather than leaving the order undefined.

2014-09-16  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcCommand.m: Simplify handling of loss of process and configuration
	error alarms.  Clear such alarms when we receive a ping from the
	process.
	EcLogger.[hm]: Add documentation in the header, plus a new method to
	make subclassing a bit easier.  Fix bug in naming of config keys.

2014-09-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Fix missing clear after unable to register with name
	server.

2014-09-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.m: If a Command server on a host registers and we already
	have a Command server registered, have the new registration replace
	the old one rather than rejecting it.  The aim is to handle a race
	condition where a Command server is re-registering after some network
	problem and the old registration is still in place.
	* EcAlerter.m: Add more debug logging to show what elarms/alerts are
	handled by what rules.

2014-07-30  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.h:
	* EcProcess.m:
	Added +ecSetup method to create/initialise the singleton instance.

2014-07-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Command.m:
	* Control.m:
	Implement auto-restart ...
	Run a 'Watcher' process as a daemon with the actual server as a
	subtask.  If the subtask dies with a status other than zero,
	restart it after a 30 second delay.

2014-06-20  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcProcess.m: Make sure the NSHost cache is flushed at least
	once per minute (by -ecNewMinute:) so that any stale information
	is replaced reasonably promptly.

2014-05-16  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmDestination.m: Perform all connection operations in
	main thread (forwarding etc) and ensure that we run the
	current run loop while waiting for startup and shutdown.
	* EcLogger.m: Use floating point flush interval for modern
	systems which run faster and might want to flush more than
	once per second.
	* EcProcess.m: Don't start handling timeouts until the
	process is actually running (so we don't get any during
	initialisation of the class).
	* GNUmakefile: bump subminor version number for release
	Version 1.1.3 release

2014-05-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcTest.h:
	* EcTest.m:
	* EcProcess.m:
	* GNUmakefile:
	Add a few simple functions to connect to a process, set/get the
	config of a running process, and issue commands (and get back
	the response) so that regression test software can relatively
	easily exercie an entire system.

2014-03-26  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcControl.m: Add option to allow any user to log in.

2014-02-22  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* EcAlarmDestination.h:
	* EcAlarmDestination.m:
	When clearing an alarm, forward the clear to the next destination
	unless we have already done so.
	When unmanaging a managed object, remove internal records of cleared
	and active alarms for that managed object.

2014-01-16  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * EcProcess.m:
        * EcAlarmDestination.h:
        * EcAlarmDestination.m:
	Remove experimental force clear method ... obey the KISS rule and
	stick to using domanange and unmanage methods for clearing on
	startup/shutdown. People wanting alars which persist after process
	shutdown should create a secondary managed object for them.

2013-07-06  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * EcConsole.m: Strip spaces from command line to avoid a space

        (still need to make this period configurable).
        Send clear message when a major/critical alarm is cleared, trying
        to get mail clients to replace original email with the clear so the             recipient can tell a problem has gone away.

2013-04-05  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

        * EcControl.m: Fix to get 'control on <host> ...' to work while
